# 🐾 Neural Petwork: Full-Stack Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains the complete code for three major Computer Vision and Deep Learning projects, demonstrating end-to-end ML workflow from data preparation to deployment-ready models.

## 🚀 Projects Completed

| Project Phase | Goal | Model & Technique | Final Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Classification** | Identify Cat vs. Dog. | CNN + MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning) | **98.7%** |
| **Phase 2: Object Detection** | Locate and identify Cat vs. Dog with bounding boxes. | Custom-trained **YOLOv8n** | **98.5% mAP50** |
| **Phase 3: Image Generation** | Generate new, fake cat faces. | **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** | *[Training discontinued due to CPU limits]* |
